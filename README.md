# 👋 Hi, I’m Adarsh Srivastava

### Founder • Full-Stack Engineer • Scalable Product Architect

I build **production-grade digital products** that scale — from zero to millions of users — with a strong focus on **performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability**.

I’m currently working on [v2 of Fastify and making a open prisma based boilerplate](v1- [https://github.com/adarshsrii/fastify-playground] v2-[https://github.com/adarshsrii/v2-fastify-playground])

Over the last decade, I’ve worked across **mobile apps, web platforms, AI-powered systems, and cloud infrastructure**, helping startups and businesses turn ideas into reliable, revenue-generating products.
